# Overview

This repository showcases two 3D modeling projects created using Blender:

Rubik's Cube – A detailed, animated representation of the classic puzzle.

Perfume Bottle (Denver) – A realistic 3D model of a perfume bottle exploring materials, textures, and lighting.

These projects highlight Blender's capabilities in 3D modeling, animation, and rendering, while providing visually engaging and interactive models.
